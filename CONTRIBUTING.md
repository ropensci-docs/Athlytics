# Contributing to Athlytics

## How to Contribute

We follow a “GitHub Flow” like process where contributions are made
through Pull Requests. To make a contribution, please follow these
steps:

1.  **Check for Existing Issues:** Before starting work on a new feature
    or bug fix, please check the [Issues
    tab](https://github.com/ropensci/Athlytics/issues) to see if someone
    else has already reported the issue or is working on it.

2.  **Open an Issue (If Necessary):**

    - **For Bug Reports:** If you find a bug, please open a new issue.
      Describe the bug clearly, including steps to reproduce it, what
      you expected to happen, and what actually happened. Include
      relevant version information for Athlytics and R.
    - **For Feature Requests:** If you have an idea for a new feature,
      please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to discuss the
      potential feature and ensure it aligns with the project’s goals
      before significant development effort is made.
    - **For Other Contributions:** If you want to contribute in other
      ways (e.g., documentation improvements, refactoring), it’s still a
      good idea to open an issue first to discuss your proposed changes.

3.  **Fork the Repository:** Fork the [Athlytics
    repository](https://github.com/ropensci/Athlytics) to your own
    GitHub account.

4.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your forked repository
    for your contribution. Choose a descriptive branch name (e.g.,
    `fix-plot-bug`, `add-new-metric`).

5.  **Make Your Changes:** Make your changes in your branch. Ensure that
    your code follows the existing style and that you add relevant tests
    for new functionality or bug fixes.

    - If you add new functions, please include Roxygen documentation.
    - Run `devtools::check()` locally to ensure your changes pass all
      checks.

6.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and
    descriptive commit message.

7.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository.

8.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**

    - Go to the original athlytics repository and open a Pull Request
      from your branch to the `main` branch (or the relevant development
      branch if specified).
    - In your PR description, clearly describe the changes you have made
      and **link to the issue you are addressing** (e.g., “Closes \#123”
      or “Fixes \#456”).
    - Ensure your PR passes any automated checks (e.g., GitHub Actions).

9.  **Discuss and Iterate:** Be prepared to discuss your changes and
    make further modifications based on feedback from the maintainers.
