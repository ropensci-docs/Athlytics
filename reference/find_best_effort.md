# Find Best Effort for Target Distance

Locates the fastest contiguous sub-segment that covers `target_distance`
within a stream. Two robustness improvements over the original
nearest-row approach:

## Usage

``` r
find_best_effort(stream_data, target_distance)
```

## Details

1.  **Strictly-monotonic-distance filter**: the input is reduced to rows
    where cumulative distance and time both strictly increase, so
    spurious backward jumps (GPS glitches, laps restarting the distance
    counter) no longer contribute fake short intervals.

2.  **Linear interpolation at both segment boundaries**: candidate
    windows may start or end between recorded samples. Interpolating
    both boundaries removes nearest-row bias on low-Hz streams and
    avoids missing end-anchored fastest efforts whose true start falls
    between samples.

3.  **Bounded candidate sweep**: candidates are generated from recorded
    starts and recorded ends shifted back by `target_distance`, avoiding
    the previous O(n^2) scan while preserving exact fixed-distance
    intervals.
